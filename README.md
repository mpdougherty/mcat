# Calculating Mussel Community Assessment Tool (MCAT) metrics
This R package has been developed to automate calculation of the MCAT metrics found in [@dunn2016] for modeling mussel habitat suitability on Upper Mississippi River Restoration (UMRR) Habitat Rehabilitation and Restoration Projects (HREP). <img src="images/HDQLO-03_h120.jpg" align="right" />

## Need
The Mussel Community Assessment Tool metrics are valuable for evaluating the health of mussel communities at the bed and sample site scale. However, their calculation can be time consuming and error prone if done manually. This R package automates these calculations to encourage their wider application. 

## Funding
This project has been funded by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) [Upper Mississippi River Restoration Program (UMRR)](https://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Missions/Environmental-Protection-and-Restoration/Upper-Mississippi-River-Restoration/). <img src="images/UMRRlogo_tag_rgb_300px.jpg" align="right" />
